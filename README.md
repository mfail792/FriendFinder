# FriendFinder

Friend finder is a full-stack web application that lets users answer a series of pre-determined questions.  How the user answers the questions will determine the type of best friend they will be matched with.  

The users are stored inside of an object within friends.js to be used for matching purposes.  After the user inputs data and answers questions, a modal is displayed letting them know who the best match is based off of comparisons with other member answers.

The app uses Express to serve HTML files along with API routes to GET and POST data.  The app also uses Javascript, Jquery, Bootstrap and CSS to power functionality/display.  

To run the application, run 'npm install' after cloning the repository to your computer.  Then, direct your browser to 'localhost:3000' to begin the matchmaking!
